termination method used for the SITS application is not closing database connections properly and causing system performance issues. The SITS team have raised with us that a number of zombie database connections have remained open and believe this is because of the way the Bots currently terminate SITS.

IMPACT
Database connections remain open each time the SITS application is launched and terminated using Kill process method - which causing system issues.

IMPACT: 
Association between records and bot results will be lost. All faculty files will be processed as one

ROOT - CAUSE:
Queue tagging doesn't provide visibility of association between record and file, only the faculty the record belongs to. Queue data itself doesn't contain data defining the parent file of a record.

WORKAROUND:
Advise stakeholders to compile all faculty data of the same type into one file. Advise risks of having multiple files of the same faculty present in root folder.

Process terminates due to a System Exception 'Edit/Duplicate Credit Item Page' not being found, but the actual cause is a log out. All subsequent retries fail.

**IMPACT**
Process will terminate after 4 consecutive exceptions of this type, but the actual cause will be misreported.

**ROOT-CAUSE**
Occasionally, Sydney Student Web will log out of its current session while trying to navigate to the Edit/Duplicate Credit Item Page. Recovery path in 'Restructure Credit Items' block in '7. Restructure Credit Items' does not attempt to log back into Sydney Student Web.

**WORK-AROUND**

- Pending cases: rerun process
- No pending cases: no rerun

**PLAN**
1. Create BluePrismPro2 database with appropriate settings (Database Size, CPU Prioritisation Allocation)
2. Apply Blue Prism application database scheme to BluePrism2 database and setup encryption scheme using the same key as what is in BluePrismPro database (important for importing credentials)
3. Import release of Everything in BluePrismPro into BluePrismPro2 database to check for any anomalies
4. Setup and test credentials in new BluePrismPro2 database to match BluePrismPro (https://trello.com/c/rge52MTe/2112-infra-setup-credentials-in-new-blueprismpro2-database)
5. Review all processes that use Tags excessively and change them before running processes in new database (https://trello.com/c/ILJD7xr7/148-infra-update-all-processes-that-use-tags-excessively-so-that-they-dont-create-massive-bpatag-tables-in-the-blue-prism-database)
6. Stop all processes, re-point application servers to new database BluePrismPro2 to let all Bot VMs connect, after all Bot VMs have connected then re-point application servers back to old database BluePrismPro and let processes continue (10 mins). This is needed for setting up resources prior to hard swap.
7. Setup Roles, Usernames, Resource Groups, and Schedules.
8. Double check everything has been moved from BluePrismPro into BluePrismPro2 database again to make sure its updated, then stop all processes running in Prod, disconnect the Application Servers, re-point  the two application servers to BluePrismPro2, turn the application servers back on, start running processes again.

A cell with the value ""25/09/2019  11:00:45 PM"" will be displayed as ""25/09/2019 23:00"".

When the _Get Worksheet As Collection_ action is used, the displayed value is fetched instead of the actual value, resulting in the omission of the seconds value.

"208","MS Excel - Fails to read in worksheet as a collection if any of the cell values contains a tab character","**ISSUE**
The _MS Excel_ object (not to be confused with _MS Excel VBO_) reads in worksheets as a collection by highlighting all cell values, copying (ctrl+c) and then splitting the copied values by the tab character. 

**IMPACT**
Since the tab character is being used as a delimiter, if any of the cell values contain a tab character, the _Get Worksheet As Collection_ action will fail. An error will be thrown asserting that a column is missing.

**ROOT-CAUSE**

**WORK-AROUND**
Remove tab characters from all cell values.

Cell values containing tab or newline characters will be surrounded by quotes.

Example:
*Westwood Plough & Harrow
May*
becomes
*""Westwood Plough & Harrow
May""*

Cell values containing newline characters will also shift the remaining cell values on the right onto a new row, corrupting the table. A screenshot has been attached.

**IMPACT**
Loss of data integrity. Corruption may occur silently, and processes may be impacted without any obvious symptoms.

**ROOT-CAUSE**
Both _MS Excel_ and _MS Excel VBO_ objects use unreliable methods of reading in Excel files as a collection (e.g. splitting by newline and tab characters).

**WORK-AROUND**
1) Cleanse all cell values of newline characters and quotation marks, but this has its own problems (e.g. cell values are no longer in their original form, which may not be acceptable under some circumstances).

2) Read in Excel files using OLE DB, which has its own problems (e.g. OLE DB automatically assigns a data type to each column, sometimes incorrectly, with no option for overriding).

Increase the timeout value passed to the call to Request or increase the SendTimeout value on the Binding. The time allotted to this operation may have been a portion of a longer timeout.""

**IMPACT**
processes terminate when attempting to load cases to the Queue

**ROOT-CAUSE**
Database performing slowly because of the ""BPASessionLog_NonUnicode"" and ""BPASessionLog_NonUnicode_pre65"" tables being larger then expected. Blue Prism recommends that the SessionLog tables have automatic archiving setup on them so that they do not build up to overly large amounts. This automatic archiving was not originally setup when the environment was initially deployed.

**WORK-AROUND**
Monitor the environment and restart processes when needed

**RESOLUTION**
1. Clean the ""BPASessionLog_NonUnicode_pre65"" table: Remove the table from the Blue Prism database as recommended by Blue Prism (see ""confirmation on dropping pre65 table.pdf"").
2. Clean the ""BPASessionLog_NonUnicode"" table: Run the ""remove-logs.sql"" script on the Dev Environment to test the outcome. The table was cleaned, however an unexpected error message occurred after the table was cleaned (An explicit value for the identity column in table 'BPASessionLog_NonUnicode' can only be specified when a column list is used and IDENTITY_INSERT is ON.) which caused the script to attempt to rollback. However, when the script attempted to rollback it failed and the outcome was that the 'BPASessionLog_NonUnicode' stayed cleaned.

**LESSONS**
GOOD: Communication with Users, Customers and Sponsors to keep them updated on the problem as well as the collaboration with ICT to resolve the problem was excellent.
IMPROVEMENT: Communication and responsiveness from the Blue Prism Vendor to assist with resolving the issue could have been better. Additionally next time an environment database is setup we will make sure to check the automated archiving is setup.
LUCKY: We have access to run scripts on the database for root-cause analysis and resolution.

processes unable to send mail from Outlook VBO Extended and it seems to be caused by the Outlook.exe windows security login. When attempting to send mail, a blank page opens (screenshot not captured) thats linked to a Outlook windows task.

If you then try open up the Outlook application manually, the Outlook.exe Windows Security Pop-up is seen (see screenshot below).

Schedules failing to run process tasks. The Schedule often starts, however its unable to start some of the tasks and so ""Aborts"" that task, which then starts the next task that is selected in the Schedule.

**IMPACT:**
Tasks that are supposed to run certain processes dont run and get skipped

**ROOT-CAUSE:**
Current hypothesis is that processes time out when attempting to query the database to start the Tasks because the fragementation percentage of certain tables in the database is too high (session table, process table, logs table). This high fragmentation could be caused by (1) high INSERT and DELETE operations to the tables and / or (2) the fact that the database is hosted on a shared SQL server. The excel document titled ""Problem Analysis"" includes the Application Event logs from 4 VMs that experienced this Problem between the 20th and the 25th of July. In each of the 4 examples, the same occurance is found where a process will complete however it fails to mark the process as COMPLETE in the Blue Prism database Session table (e.g. ""Failed to set session status on d2e7ce8f-2ead-4f9c-86e5-3d21891ae7a9 to COMPLETED : Execution Timeout Expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.""). This timeout then prevents the next scheduled task to run until at least a minute has passed (see P6 and P50 examples in excel document). The timeout prevents any other scheduled tasks from running because the VM connection gets aborted, showing an ""Warning"" error in the Application Event Logs (e.g. ""Disconnected 10.83.28.96 - System.IO.IOException: Unable to write data to the transport connection: An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine. ---> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine""). 

**WORK-AROUND:**
1. assess impact
2. contact business if impact is high

**IMPACT**
Subprocess will terminate and the *security_licence_report* SQL table will not be updated.

**ROOT-CAUSE**
The subprocess accesses a SharePoint list. However, permission to view this list has been granted to the email blueprism.bot@sydney.edu.au only. If Excel is licensed to a different email (e.g. if it is using blueprism.bot5@sydney.edu.au), then the Excel SharePoint file will not be able to retrieve the data from the SharePoint list.

**WORK-AROUND**
Ensure that account being used for Excel is blueprism.bot@sydney.edu.au.

Microsoft Office credentials causing other processes to terminate because login Limit is reached

**IMPACT**
Confusion when installing new VMs and future issue for when automating installations such as processes terminating when attempting to use Excel because of login limit being reached

**ROOT-CAUSE**
maximum limit of Office logins being reached, often this is the BluePrismBot login because the current VM Maintenance Bot uses this login to reconfigure Outlook when it breaks

**WORK-AROUND**
The below steps will simply log out the user that has reached its limit (likely to be BluePrismBot) and re-login using the new user which has not yet reached its limit.

1. Open ""Resource Setup SOP"" in attached docs
2. Navigate to section ""Standard Runtime Resource VM Setup""
3. The 2nd Step is titled ""Install Office 365 Pro Plus"", using one of the credentials in this step, do the following
3.1. Open Excel
3.2. Sign out of all accounts currently logged into Excel (e.g. BluePrismBot)
3.3. Sign into Office 365 via Excel using the new credential

One of the 3 reports the bot generates, the ""BOT Process Output"" is only stored in runtime memory. If there is a crash, or the exception handling fails, this data will be lost. This report is valuable to P14 stakeholders.

IMPACT: 
Bot Process Output report will be lost with no possibility of recovery

ROOT - CAUSE:
Process has no ""write as you go"" solution to an excel file or queue storage option

WORKAROUND:
Two solutions:
1.
Run bot in debug mode and breakpoint on the main page recover stage to stop the bot and manually process the exception. 

2.
Rely on existing exception handling to write out the output data as per the existing code.

minimal as the User gets logged out however the actual license that the VM consumes for accessing Excel stays valid so that application works completely
