IMPACT: 
Association between records and bot results will be lost. All faculty files will be processed as one

ROOT - CAUSE:
Queue tagging doesn't provide visibility of association between record and file, only the faculty the record belongs to. Queue data itself doesn't contain data defining the parent file of a record.

WORKAROUND:
Advise stakeholders to compile all faculty data of the same type into one file. Advise risks of having multiple files of the same faculty present in root folder.

"96","MS Excel VBO - Cell values containing newline characters will (1) be surrounded by quotes and (2) corrupt the table","**ISSUE**
Cell values containing tab or newline characters will be surrounded by quotes.

Example:
*Westwood Plough & Harrow
May*
becomes
*""Westwood Plough & Harrow
May""*

Cell values containing newline characters will also shift the remaining cell values on the right onto a new row, corrupting the table. A screenshot has been attached.

**IMPACT**
Loss of data integrity. Corruption may occur silently, and processes may be impacted without any obvious symptoms.

**ROOT-CAUSE**
Both _MS Excel_ and _MS Excel VBO_ objects use unreliable methods of reading in Excel files as a collection (e.g. splitting by newline and tab characters).

**WORK-AROUND**
1) Cleanse all cell values of newline characters and quotation marks, but this has its own problems (e.g. cell values are no longer in their original form, which may not be acceptable under some circumstances).

2) Read in Excel files using OLE DB, which has its own problems (e.g. OLE DB automatically assigns a data type to each column, sometimes incorrectly, with no option for overriding).

One of the 3 reports the bot generates, the ""BOT Process Output"" is only stored in runtime memory. If there is a crash, or the exception handling fails, this data will be lost. This report is valuable to P14 stakeholders.

IMPACT: 
Bot Process Output report will be lost with no possibility of recovery

ROOT - CAUSE:
Process has no ""write as you go"" solution to an excel file or queue storage option

WORKAROUND:
Two solutions:
1.
Run bot in debug mode and breakpoint on the main page recover stage to stop the bot and manually process the exception. 

2.
Rely on existing exception handling to write out the output data as per the existing code.

RESOLUTION:
Add an additional queue to store this data or use a ""write as you go"" solution to write data to a form of non-volatile storage.","PROBLEM","Testing","P14","P14.Queue Processor V2 - Process Output file only stored in runtime memory"

2. Apply Blue Prism application database scheme to BluePrism2 database and setup encryption scheme using the same key as what is in BluePrismPro database (important for importing credentials)
3. Import release of Everything in BluePrismPro into BluePrismPro2 database to check for any anomalies
4. Setup and test credentials in new BluePrismPro2 database to match BluePrismPro (https://trello.com/c/rge52MTe/2112-infra-setup-credentials-in-new-blueprismpro2-database)

6. Stop all processes, re-point application servers to new database BluePrismPro2 to let all Bot VMs connect, after all Bot VMs have connected then re-point application servers back to old database BluePrismPro and let processes continue (10 mins). This is needed for setting up resources prior to hard swap.
7. Setup Roles, Usernames, Resource Groups, and Schedules.
8. Double check everything has been moved from BluePrismPro into BluePrismPro2 database again to make sure its updated, then stop all processes running in Prod, disconnect the Application Servers, re-point  the two application servers to BluePrismPro2, turn the application servers back on, start running processes again.

"175","OUTLOOK - Outlook VBO Extended processes unable to send mail from Outlook VBO and it seems to be caused by the Outlook.exe windows security login","**ISSUE**
processes unable to send mail from Outlook VBO Extended and it seems to be caused by the Outlook.exe windows security login. When attempting to send mail, a blank page opens (screenshot not captured) thats linked to a Outlook windows task. After killing that task, the Outlook VBO Extended will recover from warning state and then attempt to send mail again. This cycle will continue until the process reaches its maximum retry logic. If you then try open up the Outlook application manually, the Outlook.exe Windows Security Pop-up is seen (see screenshot below).

**IMPACT**
process gets stuck in warning state until manually intervened

**ROOT-CAUSE**
TBC - likely because the Outlook VBO Extended does not have the functionality to handle for the windows security login so it fails

**WORK-AROUND**
1. kill Outlook task until process stops running
2. assess if process needs to be re-run
3. re-run if required

"201","INFRA - schedules failing to run process tasks","**ISSUE:**
Schedules failing to run process tasks. The Schedule often starts, however its unable to start some of the tasks and so ""Aborts"" that task, which then starts the next task that is selected in the Schedule.

**IMPACT:**
Tasks that are supposed to run certain processes dont run and get skipped

**ROOT-CAUSE:**
Current hypothesis is that processes time out when attempting to query the database to start the Tasks because the fragementation percentage of certain tables in the database is too high (session table, process table, logs table). This high fragmentation could be caused by (1) high INSERT and DELETE operations to the tables and / or (2) the fact that the database is hosted on a shared SQL server. The excel document titled ""Problem Analysis"" includes the Application Event logs from 4 VMs that experienced this Problem between the 20th and the 25th of July. In each of the 4 examples, the same occurance is found where a process will complete however it fails to mark the process as COMPLETE in the Blue Prism database Session table (e.g. ""Failed to set session status on d2e7ce8f-2ead-4f9c-86e5-3d21891ae7a9 to COMPLETED : Execution Timeout Expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.""). This timeout then prevents the next scheduled task to run until at least a minute has passed (see P6 and P50 examples in excel document). The timeout prevents any other scheduled tasks from running because the VM connection gets aborted, showing an ""Warning"" error in the Application Event Logs (e.g. ""Disconnected 10.83.28.96 - System.IO.IOException: Unable to write data to the transport connection: An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine. ---> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine""). 

**WORK-AROUND:**
1. assess impact
2. contact business if impact is high
2. re-run process if possible

Increase the timeout value passed to the call to Request or increase the SendTimeout value on the Binding. The time allotted to this operation may have been a portion of a longer timeout.""

**IMPACT**
processes terminate when attempting to load cases to the Queue

**ROOT-CAUSE**
Database performing slowly because of the ""BPASessionLog_NonUnicode"" and ""BPASessionLog_NonUnicode_pre65"" tables being larger then expected. Blue Prism recommends that the SessionLog tables have automatic archiving setup on them so that they do not build up to overly large amounts. This automatic archiving was not originally setup when the environment was initially deployed.

**WORK-AROUND**
Monitor the environment and restart processes when needed

**RESOLUTION**
1. Clean the ""BPASessionLog_NonUnicode_pre65"" table: Remove the table from the Blue Prism database as recommended by Blue Prism (see ""confirmation on dropping pre65 table.pdf"").
2. Clean the ""BPASessionLog_NonUnicode"" table: Run the ""remove-logs.sql"" script on the Dev Environment to test the outcome. The table was cleaned, however an unexpected error message occurred after the table was cleaned (An explicit value for the identity column in table 'BPASessionLog_NonUnicode' can only be specified when a column list is used and IDENTITY_INSERT is ON.) which caused the script to attempt to rollback. However, when the script attempted to rollback it failed and the outcome was that the 'BPASessionLog_NonUnicode' stayed cleaned.

**LESSONS**
GOOD: Communication with Users, Customers and Sponsors to keep them updated on the problem as well as the collaboration with ICT to resolve the problem was excellent.
IMPROVEMENT: Communication and responsiveness from the Blue Prism Vendor to assist with resolving the issue could have been better. Additionally next time an environment database is setup we will make sure to check the automated archiving is setup.
LUCKY: We have access to run scripts on the database for root-cause analysis and resolution.

- 17th May
- 21st May
- 29th May

IMPACT
Process gets stuck in warning state until manaully actioned

ROOT-CAUSE
There might be some wait required after entering requester identifier and before selecting the checkbox, because application takes a second to refresh the table.
We can confirm this after multiple runs in Prod.

processes terminating with error message ""specified cast is not valid"". When the process attempts to ""Get Mail"" using the Outlook VBO it throws the error message ""Specified cast is not valid"". This also occurs after attempting to open the ""HDRAC Ops"" outlook profile.

**IMPACT**
This problem seems to only be effecting the Email SID Labelling processes noted below:
- P35
- P34

**ROOT-CAUSE**
there are few types of mails which blueprism vbo code does not handle for eg: - outlook messages where sender email id is missing - these kinds of messages originated from outlook itself for eg:- giving a warning message as your mailbox is full, archive folder is almost full etc . if any such messages are there in your inbox, it will always fail irrespective of how many attempts you try. (https://www.rpaforum.net/threads/exception-thrown-by-code-stage-specified-cast-is-not-valid.10813/)

"218","BluePrism - Schedule failure logs are not created when a schedule is failed","**ISSUE**
Recent scheduler activities are not logged. If a process is manually started from the scheduler using the ""Run Now"" option and the VM that the initial task is scheduled to run on, then the Application Server will fail to start the schedule and throw the below three sequence of ""information"" messages in the windows blue prism application logs (P21 schedule as an example). However, 

*1. FIRST INFORMATION MESSAGE*
""BPServer.ServerService
Scheduler: 'P021 - Daily at 4am - VM98 / VM103 : [17/10/2019 04:00:00]': Firing""

*2. SECOND INFORMATION MESSAGE*
""BPServer.ServerService
Scheduler: 'P021 - Daily at 4am - VM98 / VM103' is still being executed from the instance at 16/10/2019 4:00:00 AM""

*3. THIRD AND LAST INFORMATION MESSAGE*
""BPServer.ServerService
Scheduler: Trigger Suppressed: P021 - Daily at 4am - VM98 / VM103 : [17/10/2019 04:00:00]""


**IMPACT**
1. scheduler anomaly monitoring will not work
2. run team does not have visibility on a failed schedule

**ROOT-CAUSE**
The user account that the Application Server uses to connect to the BluePrism database does not have access to send mail, which is a function one of the stored procedures needs.

**WORK-AROUND**
manually checking the schedule for critical processes

**RESOLUTION**
Update the access needed for the send mail function (see attached image)
